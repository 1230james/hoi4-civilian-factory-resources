# Civilian Factory Resources

For Hearts of Iron IV

## Overview

**Civilian Factory Resources** (CFR) is a mod for [Hearts of Iron IV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/394360/Hearts_of_Iron_IV/) that adds a resource usage cost to civilian factories, acting as a soft cap or penalty to countries who build too many of them in later portions of the game.

CFR will calculate an amount of steel and chromium required as an "input" for the current number of civilian factories in the country. If there aren't adequate resources, the output of all civilian factories will be penalized, scaling based on the amount of resources that are missing.

Inspired by [FeedBackGaming's video discussing the [lack of] uses for Chromium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxgL2gR7hZQ).
